Frior the loract is the way to go in the time of the future is mine in this way I wasn't seeing the flavor of the darkness in my lifeit was only in the blank state of the mind did the rise of men fall to the tower's tip. The oceans call allured many weak men to the point were they only saw how to perform the powerful rituals of the light after the men came to call their faces. The fig in the tree attracts many bees, the light in the eyes of the weak are the darkness in the stars of death. 

There was once a boy named joseph he was the weakest of the troup and could only perform one trick. Shunned and stiffled he was never able to be the same after they performed some basic tricks. As his skills grew the only way to get better was to fail in a way that the others did not know this was the challenge in the light. This is how we train. through failure did our right become the darkness


This is the kind of file that people hate that which points out the fear in faced by the weak willed and awkward hearted. This is the truth in light is faced through trial and error. In order to generate new texts the men work through their difficulties. I hate facing the work the way I do. What is the goal of my project? To build something that extracts knowledge from text and builds a new standard for information generation. Text is the abstractoin for which knowledge is transfered. some do not have faith so they must be :wq
