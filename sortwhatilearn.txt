heap:
I really should wrap the heap in a struct to keep track of its "current length", it would also make things better for typesafety. I have the distinction between min and max heaps. 

quicksort:
I really should do the method with 4 partitions, its easier to code and remember.

the first partition represents all the elements in the vector that are known to be less than the element
the second represents the ones that are greater than
the third are unkown and the last is the element itself

I neeed to keep track of 4 indexes, left, right, i, j. 

i starts at -i if the element at j which goes from 0 to the length is greater than the pivot we then increment i and swap the elements at i and j. 

at the end of the loop we swap i+1 and right 

i keeps track of the break between partition 0 and 1. 

I return i + 1 because thats wher ethe split takes place

I can pick a random spot by swapping a random index and putting it in the right most position
